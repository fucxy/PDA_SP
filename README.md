# PDA_SP
This is our sequence pair implentation for Physical design automation in NCTU.

We follow the paper "Implement : Rectangle Packing Based Module Placement - Sequence Pair" to make it.

# How We Make It

We will decribe how we made it!

## From a floorplan to its sequence pair

>Stretch modules one by one to obtain rooms, each room containing only one module.


## Positive / Negative loci

>For each module i, we draw two rectilinear curves, right-up locus and left-down locus.
The union of the two loci of module i forms the positive locus of module i. 
Negative loci can be obtained similar to the positive loci.
The difference is that a negative locus is the union of the up-left locus and down-right locus.
